# pqc analysis

PQC Analysis is a Python package for analyzing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) via geometric and topological methods.  
It provides tools for:

- **Geometric analysis** of PQCs using Fubini-Study metric tensors
- **Topological data analysis (TDA)** via persistent homology on PQC state spaces
